# Boot2docker Vagrant Box
Boot2docker Vagrant box for optimized Docker and Docker Compose use on Mac and Windows.


## What is this?

This is a temporary solution to achieve better performance with synced folders and docker data volumes on Mac and Windows.

The stock boot2docker/docker-machine mounts host volumes via VirtualBox Guest Additions (vboxsf) mode, which is is terribly slow. Much better performance can be achieved with **nfs** (Mac), **smb** (Windows) or **rsync** (Mac and Windows).

## Prerequisites
1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 5.0+
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.7.3+
3. [Babun](http://babun.github.io) - A Linux-type shell, **Windows only**

For best result and a clean setup it is recommended to remove any previous versions of VirtualBox, Vagrant, boot2docker, docker and docker-compose.

Automatic **installation** and **updates** of prerequisites is available via the one-liners below.  
**Make sure to stop all VirtualBox VMs prior to performing updates.**

**Mac**

Prerequisites are installed using **brew/cask** (brew and cask will be installed if missing).

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant/master/scripts/presetup-mac.sh)

**Windows**

**All automated scripts and instructions in this project assume using Babun shell and are not tested with other shells.**

Prerequisites are installed using **babun** and **chocolatey** (chocolatey will be installed if missing).

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant/master/scripts/presetup-win.sh)

**Windows (alternative)**

If you don't want babun, run this script in administrator mode (right clic execute into administrator), the file must be in your computer for security purpose.

    /scripts/presetup-win.cmd

Then you must continue using manual installation

## Setup and usage

### Automatic installation

Designate a root folder that the VM will have access to (e.g. `~/Projects`) and run there:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant/master/scripts/setup.sh)

### Manual installation

1. Copy `Vagrantfile` and `vagrant.yml` into a designated folder
2. Inside the folder run

    ```
    vagrant up
    ```

3. Verify your setup by checking docker client and server versions

    ```    
    docker version
    ```
